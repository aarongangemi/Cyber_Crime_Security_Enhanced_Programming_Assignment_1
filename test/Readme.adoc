= ISEC3004 assignment TEST FOLDER README
Contains:
test case python scripts:
- functionality_test (Tests the basics functionality of all the different use cases)
- redos_email_test.py (To check if redos can occur when email is entered on the registration screen)
- redos_regextest_test.py (To check if redos can occur when regex test inputs are entered on regex test screen)
- redos_spacetrimmer_test.py  (To check if redos can occur when space trimmer input is entered)
- redos_username_test.py (To check functionality of username registration and whether redos will occur)

Note: in Master branch tests for redos should not pass the tests and in the patchBranch they should pass and no redos
should occur

Other files:
- setup_geckodriver.sh (runs the set that install the geckodriver requirements)
- setup_python.sh (sets up the other requirements for the environment needed for testing)
- test_requirements.txt (file used by setup_python.sh containing the packages required)


== How to Setup Test Environment

- cd into test directory
- ./setup_python.sh (set up requirements and environment for testing)
- ./setup_geckodriver.sh (set up geckodriver requirements)
- source ccsep-env/bin/activate (run from test directory to activate the environment)
- deactivate (to deactivate test environment when finished)

== How to Run Tests

- ensure testing environment is activated (source ccsep-env/bin/activate)
- make sure website is built and running:
    - from another terminal make sure you are in the CCSEP_Assignment directory, the root directory of the project
    - enter "make build" to build the project
    - enter "make run" to start the web server
- cd into test folder
- python3 <name of python test file>.py (runs particular test)
- use command "deactivate" to deactivate the virtual environment

== Tests

functionality_test.py:
- Test the basic functionality of the website
- Functionality tests:
    1. Test invalid username: (URL: http://localhost:8000)
        - username input: "aa!"                           (INVALID: should only contain letters a-z and A-Z)
        - email input: "a@a.com"                          (VALID)
        - expected output: "Error: invalid username"
    2. Test invalid email: (URL: http://localhost:8000)
        - username input: "aa"                            (VALID)
        - email input: "a@.com"                           (INVALID: must contain domain after @ symbol)
        - expected output: "Error: Invalid Email"
    3. Test valid register: (URL: http://localhost:8000)
        - username input: "aa"                            (VALID)
        - email input: "a@a.com"                          (VALID)
        - expected output: switch to regextest screen
          "id_regexString" should be present
    4. Test matching regex and input string:(URL: http://localhost:8000/regextest)
        - regexString input: "abc"                        (VALID)
        - inputString input: "abcdd"                      (VALID)
        - expected output: "Result: String
          found in regex"
    5. Test non-matching regex and input string (URL: http://localhost:8000/regextest)
        - regexString input: "abce"                       (VALID)
        - inputString input: "abcdd"                      (VALID)
        - expected output: "Result: no result"
    6. Test invalid regex input (URL: http://localhost:8000/regextest)
        - regexString input: "("                          (INVALID: should be an a regular expression)
        - inputString input: "abcdd"                      (VALID)
        - expected output: "Error: invalid regex"
    7. Test string that needs trimming (URL: http://localhost:8000/inputTrim)
        - spacetestInput input: "   abc a  "              (VALID)
        - expected output: "Trimmed String: abc a"
    8. Test string that doesn't need trimming (URL: http://localhost:8000/inputTrim)
        - spacetestInput input: "abc a"                   (VALID)
        - expected output: "Result: Nothing
          needed trimming"
    9. Test going to regex and space trimmer page via buttons (URL: http://localhost:8000/inputTrim)
        - input: press the goToRegex button               (VALID)
        - expected output: switches to the regex page
          hence id_regexString should be present

redos_email_test.py: (URL: http://localhost:8000/)
- tests whether redos occurs on register page when dangerous input is enter into email field and submitted
- NOTE: DUE TO A LARGE NUMBER OF @ SYMBOLS MAY TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO BUFFER
- Steps:
    - username input: "tester"
    - email input: "@" * 200000
    - register button pressed
    - expected result MASTER: proceeds to load for over 10 seconds and a timeout occurs, test file outputs
      "ReDos was caused" to terminal.
    - expected result patchBranch: "Invalid Email" output to website. Test file outputs "No ReDos occurred to terminal"

redos_regextest_test.py: (URL: http://localhost:8000/)
- tests whether redos occurs on the regex test screen when an evil regex is entered as the regex and and input is
  entered that will cause catastrophic backtracking when trying to match
- Steps:
    - username input: "ReDosTester"
    - email input: "a@a.com"
    - register button pressed (GOES TO REGEX INPUT SCREEN)
    - regexString input: "^((a+)+)$" (EVIL REGEX)
    - inputString input: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" (INVALID STRING)
    - expected result MASTER: proceeds to load for over 10 seconds and a timeout occurs, test file outputs
      "ReDos was caused" to terminal.
    - expected result patchBranch: "No result" output to website. Test file outputs "ReDos was not caused"

redos_spactrimmer_test.py:
- tests whether redos occurs on the space trimmer screen when a dangerous input is entered into the space trimmmer input
  field and the submit button is selected.
- NOTE IT MAY TAKE A FEW SECONDS TO LOAD DUE TO THE LARGE AMOUNT OF SPACES
- Steps:
    - username input: "ReDosTester"
    - email input: "a.a@a.com"
    - register button pressed (GOES TO REGEX INPUT SCREEN)
    - goToSpaceBtn pressed  (GOES TO SPACE TRIMMER SCREEN)
    - spaceInput: "asd" + " "*100000 + "asd"
    - expected result MASTER: proceeds to load for over 10 seconds and a timeout occurs, test file outputs
      "ReDos was caused" to terminal.
    - expected result patchBranch: "asd" as trimmed output to website as it should not be able to input all the spaces
      due to limited input size. Test file outputs "ReDos was not caused"

redos_username_test.py:
- tests whether redos occurs on the registration screen when a dangerous username is entered into the username field and
  then submitted.
- Steps:
    - username input: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
    - email input: "a@a.com"
    - register button pressed (GOES TO REGEX INPUT SCREEN)
    - expected result MASTER: proceeds to load for over 10 seconds and a timeout occurs, test file outputs
      "ReDos was caused" to terminal.
    - expected result patchBranch: "invalid username" output to website and test file outputs "No ReDos occurred to
      terminal"
