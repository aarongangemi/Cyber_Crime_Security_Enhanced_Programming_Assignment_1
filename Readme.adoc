KAAS - REDOS EXAMPLE README

Program Description:
Using django a python web framework we created a basic web application to show the regular expression denial of service
(redos) vulnerability. This program was created with the intent of showing users how a redos can affect a website,
how it can be detected and how it can be patched.

The website itself is a basic String manipulation website. Once the website is opened in a browser the user can
enter a username and an email into two textfields to registers themselves. Once these details are correctly submitted
the website will open a webpage allowing them to test regular expressions. The user can enter a regular expression
and a string that will be checked to see if it matches.

How to run the program:

- cd to the CCSEP_Assignment directory
- make build (build program)
- make run (run website)
- in browser enter url "http://localhost:8000/" to open the website

How to detect:

 - Simply enter any string that may or may not cause the redos to occur.
 - If the website takes a significant amount of time to process the string, then a redos has occured.
 - You will know when this happens because you will not be able to perform any action in the website while the redos is happening.

How to exploit:

 - Need to exploit a vulnerable/evil regex by inputting specific large string that can trigger the redos
		- e.g. Use "\s+$" as the regex (without the quotation marks). This regex will match for any whitespaces at the end of an input string.
         However when you input any character at the end of the string other than whitespaces, the regex engine backtracks and tries to
         match again. When inputting very large number of whitespace in the middle of the string can cause catastrophic backtracking and
         can cause the regex engine to consume all the system resource triggering a redos.
 - Since the website allows the user to select any regex and string combination for testing, the user can simply look up any cases of
   vulnerable/evil regex and string combo and try it out.

How to patch:

 - Limit the input size of the string so no unnecessarily large string can overload the regex engine. Having a very large input string is often
   required to trigger the redos so this can significantly lower the chance of redos triggering.
   - e.g. Set [max_length = 100] in the input field.
 - Update the regex engine so it can process strings faster.
   - This involved changing the regex engine that was used to match strings. Instead of using the inbuilt python re
     engine, we installed the rure regex engine. This engine always takes a linear amount of time to match an input to
     a regex as the engine no longer backtracks to try and find a match. This hence stops any exponential search times from occurring.
     This does cause some regex features to be lost such as backreferences and arbitrary lookaround but this is the only
     way to ensure that when a user enters their own regex and input to match that a redos does not occur.
