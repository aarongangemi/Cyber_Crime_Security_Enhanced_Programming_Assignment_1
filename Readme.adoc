KAAS - REDOS EXAMPLE README

Program Description:
Using django a python web framework we created a basic web application to show the regular expression denial of service
(redos) vulnerability. This program was created with the intent of showing users how a redos can affect a website,
how it can be detected and how it can be patched.

The website itself is a basic String manipulation website. Once the website is opened in a browser the user can
enter a username and an email into two textfields to registers themselves. Once these details are correctly submitted
the website will open a webpage allowing them to test regular expressions. The user can enter a regular expression
and a string that will be checked to see if it matches.

How to run the program:
- cd to the CCSEP_Assignment directory
- make build (build program)
- make run (run website)
- in browser enter url "http://localhost:8000/" to open the website
